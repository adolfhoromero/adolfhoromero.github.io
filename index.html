    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, where I study how labor organizations, worker centers, and migrant-led movements build power and advance dignity in precarious workplaces. My research examines how unions and non-profits navigate internal inequalitiesâ€”across class, race, ethnicity, gender, and languageâ€”to foster leadership, sustain collective action, and redefine labor rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use qualitative methods, including ethnographic observation and interviews in Spanish and English, to understand how workersâ€”especially immigrants and people of colorâ€”organize across difference. My work is grounded in community-engaged research and draws from labor studies, migration studies, and critical theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Cornell, I served as Assistant Director of the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program (SPOHP) at the University of Florida, where I led multilingual oral history projects documenting the experiences of Latinx, African American, and Indigenous communities across the U.S. South. I also worked with farmworker advocacy organizations and hold a background in Latin American Studies.
