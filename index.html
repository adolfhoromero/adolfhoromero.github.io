          I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, where I study how labor organizations, worker centers, and migrant-led movements build power and advance dignity in precarious workplaces. My research examines how unions and non-profits navigate internal inequalities—across class, race, ethnicity, gender, and language—to foster leadership, sustain collective action, and redefine labor rights.

          I use qualitative methods, including ethnographic observation and interviews in Spanish and English, to understand how workers—especially immigrants and people of color—organize across difference. My work is grounded in community-engaged research and draws from labor studies, migration studies, and critical theory.

          Before Cornell, I served as Assistant Director of the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program (SPOHP) at the University of Florida, where I led multilingual oral history projects documenting the experiences of Latinx, African American, and Indigenous communities across the U.S. South. I also worked with farmworker advocacy organizations and hold a background in Latin America
